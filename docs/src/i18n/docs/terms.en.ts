These terms govern the <strong>optional online services</strong>: the NoteFlow Account and the paid NoteFlow AI and NoteFlow Cloud plans. Plans are sold through Lemon Squeezy, renew automatically and can be cancelled at any time. One thing deserves emphasis: <strong>NoteFlow Cloud always encrypts your notes, and offers an optional private mode with end-to-end encryption — if you turn it on and lose both your passphrase and your recovery code, nobody (including us) can recover your notes.</strong>',
