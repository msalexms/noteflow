// Pure decision logic for what the app does with the PAID subsystems (NoteFlow
// Cloud + managed NoteFlow AI) when the account session appears or disappears.
// Lives in electron/ (not src/lib/) for the same reason as entitlements.ts:
// tsconfig.electron.json (rootDir: 'electron') cannot import renderer code, and
// only the main process owns this state. Covered by
// tests/electron/accountTransition.test.ts; main.ts applies the returned plan.
//
// Principle: signed out, the app falls back to its free/local state — the paid
// bits are an OFFER, never a broken possession — but NOTHING is destroyed:
// neither notes nor configuration. So on sign-out we turn Cloud sync OFF (which
// releases the mutual exclusion and lets GitHub Sync resume), we DROP the DEK
// (this machine must no longer be able to decrypt the user's notes, and a second
// account signing in here must never inherit the first one's key) and we revert
// the assistant to a BYO/local provider. What was on is remembered — WITHOUT any
// secret — in a small `accountRestore` record so signing back in with the SAME
// identity puts it all back, provided the entitlement is still alive.
